## Overview
### Description
**SongSwap** is an application that allows users to maintain a social media feed explicitly for music via the Spotify API. It will allow users to post songs they enjoy, see and comment on the songs that their friends have posted and see their friends' top songs! All music will be streamed natively in the application and the music found on the platform can be added to playlists natively as well. Additionally, we hope to implement a "Song of the Day" feature to further showcase the design team's love of music. 

- **Category:** Social, Entertainment, Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be originally developed on mobile, much like other social media applications (Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
- **Story:** Music is a large part of building relationships and connecting with others. Our app will allow people to easily share music with their friends rather than using a messaging app where they can only send links. 
- **Market:** Any Spotify user can use this app. Ability to follow friends and view their suggested songs allows the users to socially connect with others through music.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often as the user would like, depending on when they want to view their friends' suggested songs and share their current music interests. We assume there will be a wide range of potential rates of viewing as we hope to make our platform similar to many other social media platforms. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with building the posting ability and a feed to see and comment music your friends have shared. Then we would add extra features like generating a playlist based off of your friends' recent songs, listing your current top 10 songs on your profile, and getting a random song of the day.
